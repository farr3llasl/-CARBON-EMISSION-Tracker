Carbon Emission Tracker

# Project Outline/Plan

For this tracker, Tkinter is used to visually interact with users. It allows users to collect carbon emissions data from the web. It plots the data with graphical representation so users can understand which country is emitting the most carbon emissions.

# Data Analysis and Visualiation Plan

Plan to do the analysis of carbon emission by countryâ€™s 10 years range and plot the data for each year's carbon emissions. Compare the carbon emissions rate of countries so users can understand which countries are the most contributing to global warming.

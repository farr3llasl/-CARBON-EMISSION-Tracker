Carbon Emission Tracker

## Project Description

The Carbon Emission Tracker is centered around the scraping of carbon emissions data (by country) from the Internet. The basic parameters of carbon emissions measurement for each country are vehicle transportation usage [car, plane, train] and household power usage. A Graphical User Interface will be be implemented for users to interact with; this tracker will track the carbon emissions of each country and plot the data to visually represent a country's carbon emissions over the course of 10 years â€” a timeline, of some sort.


## Project Outline/Plan

### Interface Plan
Tkinter will be used to implement an interface that'll allow for users to collect and interact with carbon emissions data from the web. The data is plotted on a graph and sorted by country such that users will be able to quickly determine which country emits the most carbon into the atmosphere.

### Data Analysis and Visualiation Plan
We intend to collect data on a country's carbon emissions over the past 10 years, then proceed to plot the carbon emissions from each year side by side. This'll allow for the the change in carbon emissions over time for two particular countries to be visualized and compared. This helps to accomplish our goal of educating users as to which country contributes the most to climate change and how their contributions have changed over the years, not to mention that it'll also help us to pinpoint what exactly is causing these trends.
